    <P>
      When you begin file analysis (with the plugin enabled) in the "Analysis Options" popup scroll to
      "Peripheral Registers" and specify the path to a file providing the definitions of peripherals present in
      your program, in case of SVD files - this is a single file, but if you are importing this data from Renode
      you will need to provide two paths, one for the peripheral definitions and one for their instantiation (a <A href="#PeripheralMaps">Peripheral Map File</A>).
    </P>

    <H2><A name="RegisterDefinitions"></A>Peripheral Definitions</H2>
    <P>
      The plugin can be pointed to a .svd or Renode RMA .json file to load the peripherals, as often you will need to
      load multiple files the plugin accepts selecting a directory or an archive (.zip, .tar, .tar.gz, .tar.xz, .7z)
      and will recursively load all files from it. You can also specify a link to a remote archive, but it must be
      prefixed with http:// or https://, the plugin will then download that archive and recurse into it.
    </P>

    <P>
      In some cases two files need to be supplied. You can either place them in a shared directory or archive them
      together. Additionally, if the files are not in the same location you can use the second data source chooser.
